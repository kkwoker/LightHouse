RECIPE   REQUIREMENTS   

At minimum, you must use at least all of the following HTML tags on your recipe web page: section, p, h1, h2, h3, ul, li, strong, em, img

Your recipe should have at least 3 sections:

Photo: No body wants to follow a recipe without some photos. You should have at least three. Maybe one per recipe instruction? Up to you.
Ingredients list: try and be creative with the formatting in this section
Directions
Keep it simple at first, focusing more on HTML structure and less on CSS styling.

Once you have a nice semantic HTML page, go ahead and style with CSS. Do your best to organize your CSS and markup based on SMACSS.



1. Image styling

	Use CSS3 styles to add rounded or circular border around the images.
	Add a drop shadow.
	Maybe crop the photos using only CSS3.
	Be creative and play around with the settings in Chrome before applying them to your CSS (for speed).


2. Styling change on hover

	Apply a hover effect to some aspect of the recipe site so that when someone hovers, it rotates/tilts, grows, changes border colour, etc or a combination of that.
	Use of CSS3 transforms is encouraged.
	Transition the effect so that the transformation is not sudden.


1. Users can mark an ingredient after they buy it.
2. Users can keep their place in the directions list as they cook.
3. Users can hide all photos.
